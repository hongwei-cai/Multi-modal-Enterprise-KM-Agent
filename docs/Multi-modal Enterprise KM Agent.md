# Multi-modal Enterprise KM Agent: Incremental Agile Development Roadmap

## Project Overview

This project aims to build an intelligent enterprise knowledge management agent capable of processing and understanding various forms of enterprise knowledge assets (documents, images, etc.). The project adopts an **agile development approach**, iterating through three key sprints to ensure each phase delivers usable product increments.

**Core Development Principles**:

- **Incremental Complexity**: Starting with a text MVP and gradually adding multi-modal capabilities.
- **Production-Readiness Orientation**: Each sprint includes performance optimization and considerations for production deployment.
- **Full-Stack Technology Coverage**: Ensuring practice with all required technical components.

The following is the overall project roadmap, illustrating the evolution of the three sprints:

## Sprint 1: Core Text Q&A MVP - "Laying the Foundation"

### Objectives

Build a locally runnable, intelligent text Q&A system based on private documents, establishing a complete data flow and foundational infrastructure.

### Core Task List

1. **Project Foundation Setup**
    - Initialize a Git repository and configure `.gitignore`(excluding large model weights, sensitive data).
    - Create a Python virtual environment and standardize dependency management (`requirements.txt`or `poetry`).
    - Design the project directory structure (modular organization: `data/`, `src/rag/`, `src/models/`, `tests/`).
2. **Document Processing and Vectorization Pipeline**
    - Implement a PDF document parser (using `pypdf`or `pdfplumber`).
    - Design a text chunking strategy (overlapping chunks, considering semantic boundaries).
    - Integrate Hugging Face Embedding models (e.g., `BGE`series).
    - Build a vector database (Chroma) for persistent storage.
3. **Large Model Inference Local Deployment**
    - Deploy Llama 3 8B model locally on GPU using vLLM.
    - Validate the model's basic Q&A capabilities (design simple test cases).
    - Implement temperature and top-p parameter adjustments.
4. **RAG Pipeline and API Development**
    - Implement a retriever (combining similarity retrieval and keyword enhancement).
    - Design prompt templates to optimize RAG response quality.
    - Develop a FastAPI interface: document upload, Q&A, health checks.
    - Add basic error handling and logging.
5. **Containerization and Environment Standardization**
    - Create a Dockerfile (multi-stage build to optimize image size).
    - Write a `docker-compose.yml`(coordinating the vector database and API services).
    - Validate the complete local process (document upload → vectorization → Q&A).

### Key Technical Stack for This Stage

`Python`, `Git`, `Docker`, `PyTorch`, `Hugging Face Transformers`, `RAG`, `vLLM`, `FastAPI`, `Chroma`, `Llama 3`

### Success Metrics (Acceptance Criteria)

1. Successfully store technical documentation PDFs in Chroma, enabling querying of document content structure.
2. Accurately answer questions like "What are the core components of the architecture mentioned in the document?" via the API based on document content.
3. vLLM-deployed Llama 3 8B model response latency below 500ms (average).
4. Docker container enables one-click startup of the complete service with a clear Git commit history.

## Sprint 2: Model Customization and Performance Optimization - "Striving for Excellence"

### Objectives

Enhance Q&A quality and system efficiency by fine-tuning the model for the domain and optimizing performance to make the model more "specialized".

### Core Task List

1. **Experiment Tracking and Data Management**
    - Integrate MLflow to track model training metrics, parameters, and artifacts.
    - Build a domain-specific QA dataset (generating Q&A pairs based on enterprise documents).
    - Design a data evaluation process and establish a benchmark test set.
2. **PEFT Fine-Tuning and Evaluation**
    - Implement LoRA configuration for fine-tuning Llama 3 8B on domain data.
    - Design comparative experiments: baseline model vs. fine-tuned model.
    - Use BLEU, ROUGE, and human evaluation to assess fine-tuning effectiveness.
    - Validate improvements in domain term understanding and answer accuracy.
3. **Model Quantization and Inference Optimization**
    - Apply INT4 quantization (using AWQ or GPTQ).
    - Optimize vLLM service configuration (parallelism, batch size).
    - Conduct stress testing: evaluate throughput, memory usage, and response latency.
4. **A/B Testing and Pipeline Optimization**
    - Implement shadow mode deployment, running both old and new models simultaneously.
    - Design online evaluation metrics (answer relevance, usefulness ratings).
    - Optimize retrieval strategies to improve chunking and re-ranking effects.

### Key Technical Stack for This Stage

`PEFT`/`LoRA`, `MLflow`, `Model Quantization`, `vLLM`, `A/B Testing`, `PyTorch`

### Success Metrics (Acceptance Criteria)

1. The fine-tuned model achieves a 10% increase in accuracy on the domain test set compared to the baseline model.
2. Quantized model memory usage reduced by 40%, with a 30% increase in inference speed.
3. A/B testing shows the fine-tuned model wins in human evaluation with over a 70% success rate.
4. MLflow comprehensively records all experiments, enabling reproducibility of the best model.

## Sprint 3: Productionization and Multi-modal Expansion - "Comprehensive Delivery"

    - Set up Grafana dashboards to visualize system status.
    - Establish a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (automated testing, building, deployment).
    - Configure log aggregation and alert mechanisms (CloudWatch).

### Key Technical Stack for This Stage

`Kubernetes`, `AWS`/`EKS`/`S3`/`EC2`, `CLIP`, `Distributed Training`/`PyTorch FSDP`, `Docker`, `Prometheus`, `CI/CD`

3. The FSDP training scheme effectively utilizes multi-GPU nodes (linear speedup ratio > 0.8).
4. The CI/CD pipeline enables one-click deployment, with monitoring covering key metrics.

## Summary and Evolution Recommendations

This three-stage roadmap ensures the systematic practice of all required technical stacks while delivering usable product increments in each sprint. According to agile development principles, each sprint should be followed by a retrospective to evaluate outcomes and adjust subsequent plans.

**Project Evolution Possibilities**:

- **Sprint 4+**: Consider adding advanced features such as audio processing, multi-agent collaboration, or real-time collaborative editing.
- **Technical Deepening**: Explore more complex RAG patterns (e.g., HyDE, sub-question decomposition) or model fine-tuning techniques (e.g., DPO).

Through this project, you will build a complete, production-grade multi-modal knowledge management system while comprehensively mastering the core skills of modern AI full-stack development. Start with Sprint 1, and remember that the core of agile is **continuous delivery and iterative improvement**!
